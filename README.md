# VisualLoop

### See it. Circle it. Fix it.

**A local-first visual feedback layer for AI-generated interfaces.**

Review a UI in a floating preview, mark the exact region that needs work, and send structured, revision-aware feedback to an AI coding workflow.

## Overview

When an AI coding agent produces a visual interface, reviewing the result often means taking screenshots, switching windows, and trying to explain exactly which element needs changing. The feedback is easy to lose, especially across multiple revisions.

**VisualLoop makes visual review a first-class part of the agent workflow.** It provides a compact desktop companion where a reviewer can inspect an SVG or HTML artifact, draw an annotation on the relevant area, add an instruction, and submit feedback tied to the artifact and revision.

VisualLoop is **not another code-generation model**. It is the review, context, and feedback layer between a person and a code-modifying agent. The currently implemented model-powered path uses Google's Gemini API through a separate local runner; it does **not** write messages into an already-running Gemini CLI chat session.

### Who is it for?

- **AI-assisted developers** who want to review generated interfaces without describing every visual issue in prose.
- **Designers and reviewers** who want to communicate location-specific changes to an engineering or agent workflow.
- **Open-source contributors and tooling teams** exploring human-in-the-loop feedback, local-first developer utilities, and agent integrations.

### The idea in one example

Instead of saying *“make the sun in the solar-system mockup bigger, but leave the orbit alone”*, mark the sun in the preview and attach the instruction **“Increase this circle by 25%; keep the orbit unchanged.”** VisualLoop associates the annotation with a specific artifact, viewport, and revision so a connected runner can act on that context.

## Demo

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/visualloop-app-capture.gif" alt="VisualLoop running web UI: live SVG preview, three real mouse-drawn annotations, feedback submission to local core, and verified revision 2" width="800" />
  <br />
  <a href="docs/assets/visualloop-app-capture.gif">Watch the VisualLoop app workflow capture</a>
  <br />
  <sub>Captured from the running VisualLoop browser UI and Core Server on commit 95a41ac. Mouse annotations, submitted feedback, source-file replacement, and revision publication use the actual application; the AI response is supplied by a deterministic local OpenAI-compatible test provider, not a live external model. This is not a native Tauri screen recording.</sub>
</div>

This capture begins in the **running VisualLoop web editor**: a flawed SVG draft is published into its actual Preview, three regions are circled using real mouse events, a correction note is entered, and **Send feedback** submits to the real Core Server. A local deterministic test provider returns a revised SVG; VisualLoop applies the source change and displays **Revision 2**. It does **not** show the initial AI generation prompt, a native Tauri window, or a live external-model response. For a fully native AI-run recording, see the [recording checklist](docs/DEMO_RECORDING.md).

### What the experience is designed to look like

1. **Publish:** A local runner registers a session and publishes an SVG or HTML artifact.
2. **Preview:** The artifact appears in a compact, floating preview; expand it for closer review.
3. **Annotate:** Mark a region and attach a written change request.
4. **Submit:** VisualLoop records a structured feedback item with annotation coordinates and revision metadata.
5. **Revise:** A configured runner consumes the feedback, updates the file, and publishes a subsequent revision.
6. **Compare and iterate:** Review the updated artifact and repeat if necessary.

The interface supports the human review steps. Automatic revision requires a connected runner and, for the current Gemini integration, a valid API key.

## Why this approach?

| Typical AI UI review | With VisualLoop |
| --- | --- |
| “The thing near the top-right looks wrong.” | Annotate the exact region on the current preview. |
| Feedback lives in screenshots and chat messages. | Feedback is represented as structured annotations and instructions. |
| It is unclear which version a comment applies to. | Feedback references a session, artifact, and revision. |
| Reviewing means switching to a separate browser or image viewer. | A Tauri desktop companion offers mini and expanded views. |
| Integrations are tightly coupled to one UI. | A local server and adapter contracts separate review from model execution. |

### Where each technology fits

| Layer | Main technologies | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native desktop** | Rust, Tauri 2 | Window lifecycle, native commands, desktop shell |
| **Review interface** | TypeScript, React, HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, Vite | Floating preview, annotations, editor interactions |
| **Local API & events** | Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify, WebSocket (`ws`), Zod | Sessions, artifact revisions, validated requests, feedback transport |
| **Shared packages** | TypeScript | Protocol types, annotation geometry, preview utilities, agent contracts |
| **Agent integration** | TypeScript, Google Gemini API (optional) | Read feedback, request a model revision, validate and write the source |
| **Build & quality** | pnpm, Vitest, Cargo, GitHub Actions | Monorepo dependencies, automated tests, Rust checks, CI |

> **Integration boundary:** Gemini is an external API used by the optional runner, not a bundled local model. Claude Code and Codex are adapter scaffolds rather than finished integrations.

---

## Extensible AI provider adapters

VisualLoop's review protocol is **not tied to Gemini**. An optional provider transport now allows the runner to select `gemini`, `openai`, `anthropic`, or an `openai-compatible` endpoint through environment variables. The Gemini API route remains the existing default. The other providers have mocked transport tests, but **have not yet been verified end-to-end with live paid APIs or native desktop captures**.

```bash
# Example: use your own OpenAI API credentials
export VISUALLOOP_AI_PROVIDER=openai
export VISUALLOOP_AI_MODEL=YOUR_MODEL_ID
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
pnpm agent:ai examples/solar-system.svg
```

The `ModelProvider` plugin interface is open for contributors to implement other services, subject to the service's API format and access requirements. See [Provider adapter guide](docs/PROVIDER_ADAPTERS.md).

## System architecture

VisualLoop is a **local-first TypeScript monorepo with a Tauri 2 desktop shell**. The desktop UI, annotation engine, preview utilities, local API, agent skill, and optional revision processors have distinct responsibilities.

The diagrams below describe two implemented integration paths: an **AI coding agent invoking the VisualLoop Skill** to open an artifact, and the **Core Server's provider-backed revision path** for SVG/HTML. An external polling runner is also available. The skill does not intercept every AI chat automatically: the agent must invoke its scripts. Claude Code and Codex direct-session adapters remain experimental, and not every provider/model combination has been live-tested.

```

**Architecture boundaries:** The agent creates the first artifact and can use `skills/visualloop/scripts/open.sh` to open it. The desktop app handles preview, annotations, and feedback composition; the Core Server owns sessions, feedback transport, revisions, and a built-in model-driven **SVG/HTML** editing path. A separate runner can also consume feedback. Previewable image files are not equivalent to directly AI-editable image source files. Provider configuration is selectable in the app, but direct integration into an existing third-party agent chat is not implied.

### Feedback-to-revision sequence

        User->>UI: Inspect corrected regions in revision N+1
    else No available revision processor
        Note over Core,UI: Feedback remains pending; no automatic revision is guaranteed
    end
```

This sequence is the **intended success path**, not evidence that every provider or agent integration has been tested live. The built-in automatic source revision currently supports **SVG and HTML**, requires a usable provider configuration, and may fail if the model response or validation fails. To avoid two processors handling one request, configure a single revision owner for a demo or deployment. The README GIF is a scripted UI mock-up until it is explicitly replaced with a verified native recording.

## Current capabilities

| Area | Implemented today | Important boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop review | Tauri 2 + React UI with compact and expanded modes, desktop window controls, and preview state | Native interaction still needs hands-on release qualification. |
| Visual annotations | Markup shapes, instructions, viewport-aware normalized geometry | Coordinate fidelity should be evaluated against real preview content. |
| Artifacts | Local SVG and HTML artifact loading/preview | Headless capture does not fully reproduce arbitrary browser-rendered content. |
| Feedback and events | Fastify API, feedback queue, session/revision records, WebSocket updates | Requires the local core service. |
| Gemini revisions | Optional Gemini API runner reads feedback, edits a local file, and republishes it | Needs `GEMINI_API_KEY`; **not** direct injection into an existing Gemini CLI session. |
| File safeguards | Workspace checks, validation for generated SVG structure, staged replacement, versioned backups | Validation is not a complete XML/HTML security or semantic correctness guarantee. |
| Other agent adapters | Agent SDK contracts and Claude Code/Codex scaffolding | Automated Claude Code/Codex revision integration is not complete. |
| Releases | CI and a cross-platform draft-release workflow are configured | No verified publicly distributed installer or stable release yet. |

## Autonomous AI Setup & Agent Skill (สั่งให้ AI เซ็ตอัพให้พร้อมใช้ทันที)

VisualLoop comes bundled with an official **Agent Skill** (`skills/visualloop/`) designed for autonomous integration with modern AI coding assistants (such as Cursor, Google Antigravity, Claude Code, Agy, and Codex).

### 1. Zero-Friction Setup via AI Prompt
You do not need to read through complex build steps. Simply clone the repository and prompt your AI coding agent:

> *"Set up VisualLoop and make it ready to use"*
>
> หรือสั่งเป็นภาษาไทย: *"ช่วยเซ็ตอัพ VisualLoop ให้พร้อมใช้งานที"*

Your AI assistant will detect `skills/visualloop/SKILL.md` and automatically run:
```bash
bash skills/visualloop/scripts/setup.sh
```

**What the setup script automates:**
- [x] Verifies all development dependencies (Node.js 22, pnpm, Rust, Cargo, Tauri 2).
- [x] Automatically configures and launches the VisualLoop Core Server daemon on `http://127.0.0.1:4178`.
- [x] Compiles and installs `/Applications/VisualLoop.app`.
- [x] Establishes local authentication tokens (`~/.visualloop/auth_token`) and AI provider models.

### 2. Autonomous Visual Generation & Circling Workflow
Whenever you instruct an AI assistant to create or modify visual artifacts:
> *"Design a cloud architecture diagram in SVG"* or *"Generate a sleek telemetry dashboard in HTML"*

The AI agent autonomously follows the VisualLoop Agent Skill protocol:
1. **Writes the file to disk** (e.g., `dashboard.html` or `diagram.svg`).
2. **Pops up VisualLoop on your screen** with one command:
   ```bash
   bash skills/visualloop/scripts/open.sh "<path-to-file>"
   ```
3. VisualLoop immediately renders the artifact in the 1024x768 canvas.
4. You circle the exact areas requiring adjustment, attach instructions, and click **Send feedback**.
5. **Live AI Revision**: The sweeping laser scanner and glassmorphic HUD visually track the AI synthesis in real time (via Gemini 3.8 Flash, OpenAI o1/gpt-4o, or Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The source file is updated atomically with versioned backups in `.visualloop_backups/`, and Revision 2 is hot-reloaded live on your canvas.

---

## Getting started

**This is a source-build developer preview**, not a polished one-click installation.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** and **pnpm 12.3.4** (the version declared by the workspace).
- **Rust stable / Cargo** and the [Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your operating system when using the native desktop app.
- Git.
- **Optional:** a Gemini API key for model-generated file revisions.

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JameMy0001/visualloop.git
cd visualloop
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 2. Start VisualLoop

```bash
pnpm start
```

The unified launcher starts the local core server (default: `http://127.0.0.1:4178`) and the Tauri desktop development app. It configures a local authentication token for the cooperating processes.

For browser-only development without a native Tauri window:

```bash
pnpm start --web
```

To run individual development services instead:

```bash
# Terminal A: core server
pnpm --filter @visualloop/core-server start

# Terminal B: Tauri desktop development window
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Try a local artifact with Gemini (optional)

In a separate terminal, from the repository root:

```bash
# Set the key in your own shell or secrets manager; do not commit it
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Start an agent runner against the included example SVG
pnpm agent:gemini examples/solar-system.svg
```

Open the VisualLoop desktop UI, review the published artifact, annotate it, and submit feedback. With the key configured, the runner requests an updated source file from the Gemini API and publishes the next revision after applying its file-safety checks.

Without `GEMINI_API_KEY`, the runner can format feedback for review, but **does not automatically edit the file**; feedback is kept pending. Model use can incur charges and sends relevant source/feedback content to Google's service.

> **Important:** The runner can change the target source file. Use Git, review the generated diff, and work on a disposable example or a branch until you are comfortable with the workflow.

### Protocol and revision model

- A **session** associates an agent/runner with a workspace.
- An **artifact** identifies a reviewable SVG or HTML source.
- A **revision** identifies the specific published version being reviewed.
- A **feedback item** includes instructions and normalized annotation bounds associated with that session, artifact, and revision.
- The **core server** queues feedback and broadcasts events; a **runner** polls for pending feedback and acknowledges it after processing.

This separation enables different agents to implement their own adapters without embedding model-specific behavior into the desktop UI.

### Local security and data flow

- The core server binds to loopback by default and requires a local token by default for protected API/WebSocket access. Tokens are stored in `~/.visualloop/auth_token`; do not share or commit them.
- The origin-checking and preview-sanitization layers reduce exposure to untrusted artifacts. HTML is previewed in a sandboxed iframe; this is a security boundary to test, not a guarantee that arbitrary untrusted content is harmless.
- The Gemini runner includes workspace path checks, SVG structure checks, backups, and staged file replacement. Keep your own version control as an additional recovery mechanism.
- Local preview and feedback transport run on your machine. **When Gemini is enabled, source code, feedback, and optionally an annotated image may leave your machine** through the API request.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the security model and vulnerability reporting instructions.

## Verification and testing

The CI workflow runs on **macOS and Ubuntu** and includes workspace builds, automated tests, TypeScript checks, Rust `cargo check`, a scripted feedback loop, the Gemini pipeline script, and a core-server CLI smoke test.

```bash
pnpm test                 # Unit and integration suites
pnpm typecheck            # Build and TypeScript type checks
pnpm demo:golden-path     # Scripted local feedback/revision plumbing test
pnpm test:gemini-e2e      # Pipeline test (offline fallback if no Gemini key)
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && cargo check
```

**What passing CI means—and what it does not:**

- The [CI workflow](https://github.com/JameMy0001/visualloop/actions/workflows/ci.yml) has passed on both supported CI runners for the recent source commits.
- `pnpm test:gemini-e2e` **uses a simulated model response when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is absent**. A green CI step is not proof of a live Google Gemini API call.
- Scripted pipeline tests do **not** replace hands-on native desktop E2E, pixel comparisons against real browser rendering, or clean installation of packaged binaries.
- The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) defines draft/prerelease build automation; successful, installable distributions must be verified separately.

For tracked qualification details, see [Release readiness](docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md) and the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Project maturity

**Developer Preview — v0.1.0 source tree.**

The architecture, local service, UI, annotation flow, Gemini runner, and automated verification are available for exploration and contribution. VisualLoop should **not** yet be represented as production-ready, a fully validated public beta, or a universally compatible desktop application.

Known work before a broad public-beta release includes:

1. **Native desktop E2E:** verify real user interaction, window behavior, review submission, and revision refresh on target platforms.
2. **Capture fidelity:** the headless SVG rasterizer implements a subset of SVG elements/commands; complex SVG, text styling, and browser-rendered HTML are not guaranteed pixel-faithful. Headless HTML capture requires a browser/WebView context.
3. **Live model evidence:** validate real Gemini API requests and nontrivial revisions with credentials provided securely, distinct from the offline simulation used by CI.
4. **Distribution:** produce, install, and smoke-test desktop packages per platform, with any required signing/notarization.
5. **Hardening:** continue negative security tests and review of generated source before file replacement.

**Platform notes:** macOS and Ubuntu are covered by source-build CI. The release configuration targets macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Linux (x86_64), and Windows (x86_64), but an OS appearing in the release matrix is **not** a claim that installers have shipped or been verified there.
